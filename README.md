<!-- ABOUT ORPHEUS -->
## About OrpheusDL - Bugs!

OrpheusDL - Bugs! is a module written in Python which allows archiving from **[bugs.co.kr](https://music.bugs.co.kr/)** for the modular music archival program.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get a local copy of Orpheus up and running:

### Prerequisites

### Installation

1. Go to your `orpheusdl/` directory and run the following command:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Dniel97/orpheusdl-bugsmusic.git modules/bugs
   ```
2. Execute:
   ```sh
   python orpheus.py

3. Now the `config/settings.json` file should be updated with the Bugs! settings

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
